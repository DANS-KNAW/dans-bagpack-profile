Scope \u00b6 This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS BagPack. This includes all the requirements for a bag to be successfully processed by the DANS Data Vault ingest workflow. Overview and Conventions \u00b6 Keywords \u00b6 The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 . The key word \"SHOULD\" is also used to specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to check by the archival organization (i.e., DANS). The client should do its best to meet these requirements but not rely on their being validated by the archival organization. Subdivisions \u00b6 The requirements are subdivided into the following sections: RDA BagPack Related - requirements that refer back to the RDA BagPack specifications. If a bag only needs to comply with the RDA BagPack specifications, then it should be sufficient to only check this section. Extra Requirements for DANS BagPack - requirements that are specific to the DANS BagPack Profile, and which are in addition to the RDA BagPack requirements. The sections are numbered and may have numbered subsections. The requirements themselves are stated as numbered rules. Rules may have parts that are labeled with letters: (a), (b), (c), etc. To uniquely identify a specific rule, use the notation <section-nr>[.<subsection-nr>].<rule-nr> [(<letter>)] Example: 2.3.4 (e) means part e of the fourth rule in subsection 3 of section 2. XML namespaces \u00b6 When referring to XML element or attribute names or attribute values that have a prefix (such as schema:name ) an element in a certain namespace is intended. The table below lists the mapping from prefix to namespace. In the actual document, the namespace may be bound to a different prefix, or be the default namespace.

RDA BagPack Related \u00b6 The following items are required by the RDA BagPack specifications: A DANS BagPack MUST be valid according to BagIt v1.0 or BagIt v0.97 . (a) A DANS BagPack MUST contain a file metadata/datacite.xml (b) this file MUST be valid according to the DataCite schema version 4.0 or later , except for the requirement that there MUST be a DOI present: a DOI is not required for a DANS BagPack; (c) DataCite's recommended properties SHOULD be present. Other files besides datacite.xml MAY be present in the metadata folder. 2. Extra Requirements for DANS BagPack \u00b6 The following items are required by the DANS BagPack Profile, in addition to the requirements of RDA BagPack: The bag-info.txt file SHOULD contain an element BagIt-Profile-Identifier set to the identifier of the DANS BagPack BagIt Profile : https://doi.org/10.17026/e948-0r32 . (a) The bag MUST conform to the DANS BagPack BagIt Profile (even if the BagIt-Profile-Identifier element pointing to it is missing). (b) The bag SHOULD conform to any other BagIt profiles declared in the BagIt-Profile-Identifier element. There MUST be a file called metadata/pid-mapping.txt : the structure of this file MUST be rows formatted as <identifier> <referenced object> , where <identifier> is a unique URI and <referenced object> is the path to the file relative to the root of the bag, and both are separated by one or more spaces. One of the lines MAY be mapping from the dataset DOI to a folder directly under the data folder. (a) There MUST a metadata/oai-ore.json file which MUST be a valid JSON-LD 1.0 or higher document; (b) The object described in the document MUST have the attribute vaultMd:dansBagId whose value is a URN:UUID. (c) The ore:AggregatedResource s of the ore:Aggregation MUST have the following attributes: (i) @id whose value is a URI; (ii) schema:name ; (iii) dvcore:restricted , with value true or false. There MUST be a one-to-one mapping between the files in the data folder and the files described in the Aggregation contained in oai-ore.jsonld file: (a) all identifiers found in 2.4(c)(i) MUST be present in the left column of pid-mapping.txt ; (b) the set of paths pointing to files found in the right column of pid-mapping.txt MUST be equal to the set of paths of files present in the data folder (relative to the bag root).","title":"v1.0.0"},{"location":"versions/1.0.0/#dans-bagpack-profile-v100","text":"","title":"DANS BagPack Profile v1.0.0"},{"location":"versions/1.0.0/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"versions/1.0.0/#version","text":"Document version: 1.0.0 Publication date: 2026-02-10","title":"Version"},{"location":"versions/1.0.0/#status","text":"The status of this document is PUBLISHED.","title":"Status"},{"location":"versions/1.0.0/#scope","text":"This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS BagPack.
