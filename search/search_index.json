Scope \u00b6 This document specifies what constitutes a DANS BagPack in its most simple form. This version of the document is a preliminary release. The requirements in it are non-normative and therefore formulated as \"SHOULD\"-rules. BagPacks that declare themselves as following the DANS BagPack Profile v0.1.0 are a best effort and are not validated. Overview and Conventions \u00b6 Keywords \u00b6 The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 . The key word \"SHOULD\" is also used to specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to check by the archival organization (i.e. DANS). The client should do its best to meet these requirements, but not rely on their being validated by the archival organization. Subdivisions \u00b6 The requirements are subdivided into the following sections: RDA BagPack Related - requirements that refer back to the RDA BagPack specifications. If a bag only needs to comply with the RDA BagPack specifications, then it should be sufficient to only check this section. Extra Requirements for DANS BagPack - requirements that are specific to the DANS BagPack Profile, and which are in addition to the RDA BagPack requirements. The sections are numbered and may have numbered subsections. The requirements themselves are stated as numbered rules. Rules may have parts that are labeled with letters: (a), (b), (c), etc. To uniquely identify a specific rule, use the notation <section-nr>[.<subsection-nr>].<rule-nr> [(<letter>)] Example: 2.3.4 (e) means part e of the fourth rule in subsection 3 of section 2. Requirements \u00b6 1. RDA BagPack Related \u00b6 The following items are required by the RDA BagPack specifications: A DANS BagPack SHOULD be valid according to BagIt v1.0 . A DANS BagPack SHOULD contain a file metadata/datacite.xml (a) this file SHOULD be valid according to the DataCite schema version 4.0 or later , except for the requirement that there MUST be a DOI present: a DOI is not required for a DANS BagPack; (b) DataCite's recommended properties SHOULD be present. Other files besides datacite.xml MAY be present in the metadata folder. The files in the metadata folder SHOULD be mentioned in the tag-manifest (this is optional in BagIt, but required by RDA BagPack). BagIt-Profile-Identifier SHOULD be provided. 2. Extra Requirements for DANS BagPack \u00b6 The following items are required by the DANS BagPack Profile, in addition to the requirements of RDA BagPack: BagIt-Profile-Identifier SHOULD contain https://doi.org/10.17026/e948-0r32 .
