DANS BagPack Profile v0.1.0
===========================

# Introduction
## Version
* Document version: 0.1.0
* Publication date: N/A
## Status
The status of this document is DRAFT
## Scope
This document specifies what constitutes an acceptable DANS bagpack. This includes all the requirements for a bag to be
successfully processed by the vault ingest workflow.
## Overview and Conventions
### Key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "
OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119]{:target=_blank}.

The key word "SHOULD" is also used to specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to check by the archival
organization (i.e. DANS). The client should do its best to meet these requirements, but not rely on their being
validated by the archival organization.
